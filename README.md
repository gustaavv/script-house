# script-house


This repo is a handy Python module for my daily use â€” [`script-house`](https://pypi.org/project/script-house/). Most of my Python projects are expected to depend on this fundamental module.

`script-house` mainly includes two packages:

- `utils`: Tools for development.
- `ops`: Tools(scripts) for daily use.

# Dependencies

Dependencies for this module are file-based. If users want to use functions from a specific file, they only need to install the corresponding dependencies (an exception will be thrown if not installed). Here is a list of dependencies for all files, which users can install in advance to avoid exceptions:

| File                     | Command to Install Dependencies                           |
